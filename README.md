# FoodHub 
EDA Project assignment DSML – MIT IDSS Course 
Refer to jupyter notebook for details on Step by Step EDA, data cleaning and visualizations

## The Business
FoodHub is a food aggregator that connects users, primarily students and busy professionals, with partner restaurants through a mobile app. Once an order is placed, a delivery person picks it up from the restaurant and delivers it to the customer, tracking the process via the app. FoodHub earns revenue by taking a fixed margin from each order placed through the platform.

## The Task
Analyze collected data on customer orders through their online platform and answer key business questions provided by the Data Science team, offering insights that will support the company's business improvements.

## Analyze 

### First look at the dataset 
*insert image 1*<br>
*insert image 2*<br>

**Observations:**
*	There are 1898 rows and 9 columns in the data
*	There are no nulls in the dataset
*	**order_id** feature is the **unique identifier** with 1898 unique order_id matching the total number of rows , there are also no nulls in this feature.
*	rating feature of the data set has "Not given" which is actually missing customer ratings. 
*	Categorical features: restaurant_name , cuisine_type, day_of_week, rating
* Numeric features : cost_of_the_order , food_preparation_time ,  delivery_time 
*	customer_id do not have a meaningful numeric relationship and is considered as categorical

### 'Not given' values in rating features
*insert image 9*<br>
Observation on distibution of rating
*   38% of customer ratings are "Not given" this is a sizeble chunk which should not be simply dropped
*   most of the ratings fall under 5 about 30.0% and 4 about 20.3% then 3 which is 9%
*   the data is strangely biased with no rows containing 1 and 2
*   treatment of these values to be studied after understanding the entire dataset

### EDA 
Below are some of the intersting insights gathered from EDA 
Insights to better understand customer demand, business partners (restaurants), what influences customer ratings and how business is different on weekndays compared to weekends<br>
*insert image 7*
*insert image 7b*
**The top 5 most ordered cuisine_types** are : American 30.7%, Japanese 24.7%, Italian 15.7%, Chinese 11.3%, Mexican 4%

*insert image 7c*
**Top 5 restaurants** in terms of the number of orders received are: 
1. Shake Shack 
2. The Meatball shop 
3. Blue Ribbon Sushi 
4. Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken 
5. Parm

**Revenue generated by restaurants in decending order**
*insert image 17*
it make sense that restaurants that recieved the most orders would generate the most revenue

**How days of week affect the number of orders**
*insert image 8*
There are more weekend orders which accounted for about 71.1% compared to weekday orders which accounts for 28.8%

**Top 3 customers**
*insert image 10*
The company has decided to give 20% discount vouchers to the top 3 most frequent customers. Find the IDs of these customers and the number of orders they placed
Top 3 frequent customers has customer_ids 52832 , 47440 and 83287 placed 13, 10 and 9 orders respectively
The top nth number of customers could be further analyzed to find out about their demographic to run better more relevant promotions 

**Understanding food preperation time and delivery time**
*insert image 5*
*insert image 6*
**Food Prep Time**
*   Food preparation time is almost uniform with a few peaks
*   The minimum time of preparation is 20 min and the maximum is 35 min.
**Food Delivery time** 
*   The distribution of Delivery time is left skewed.
*   There is no outliers in this variable.
*   75% of the orders are delivered in less than 28.

**How days of week affect the number of orders**
*insert image 11a*
*insert image 11b*
<br>
Observation<br>
* We see higher delivery times in the weekdays mean at 28 mins compared to weekends with mean delivery time 22 mins
* There is a wider range in delivery times in the weekends
<br>
This could a problem causing a bottleneck in fulfilling the higher demand in the weekends. The reason for longer delivery time should be investigated.
A few possible reasons could be the lack of man power in the delivery crew / traveling methods used by the delivery crew / non optimized travel route these within the control of the food aggregator and solutions can be put in place 

**What affect customer ratings**

To understand what affect customer ratings we have to address the elephant in the room : **'Not given' values in rating features** <br>
**Steps to take :**
* check with the team if we can get the actual values, if can we supplement this information with another dataset
* if the above is not possible, Explore the "Not given" values in rating feature to see if we could find a pattern that would correlate to the missing values
* As this is a sizable check of data (38% of lastly Impute these values with mean rating 

**Observation** : After exploring the distribution of the data in 'Not given values, the  proportion of missing values is fairly consistent throughout all features. There is no pattern or correlation to the rating 'Not given' values with the other features. We could say that the 'Not given' vaules are missing at random. <br>
Therefore to be able to make inferencees from the rating feature by agg
